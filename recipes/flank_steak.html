      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Marinade:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steak:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Add flank steak to the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li>If you're not in a rush, we recommend marinating your flank steak for least 6 hours (or up to 12) for the most tender, flavorful steak.</li>
      </ol>
